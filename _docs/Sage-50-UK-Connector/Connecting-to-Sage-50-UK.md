title: Connecting to Sage 50 UK
---

All of the tasks in the Sage 50 UK connector require a connection to a Sage 50 company, so you will need to create a connection with the type 'Sage 50 UK'. See [Managing Connections](managing-connections) for instructions on creating a new connection. You will see a screen like the one below, requesting your Sage 50 details:

Enter your Sage 50 details as described below, then click 'Finish' to create the connection.
