The BigCommerce connector for Zynk allows you to easily integrate with your BigCommerce website. It provides tasks to download order, product and customer information in XML format, and upload products and stock levels.

Each of the tasks require a connection to BigCommerce, for more information on setting up and managing connections see [Connecting to BigCommerce](connecting-to-bigcommerce).
