title: Importing Order Updates into BigCommerce
---
This task will change the status of orders in your BigCommerce store. It can be used in conjunction with the Download Stage setting on the [Downloading Orders from BigCommerce](downloading-orders-from-bigcommerce) task, to change the status of orders once they have been processed to prevent them downloading again.

## Settings
### Connection
_Required_  
The BigCommerce connection to use. See the [Connecting to BigCommerce](connecting-to-bigcommerce) article if you require more information on how to create/manage connections.

### Input File
_Required_  
The XML file containing the orders to update. These should be stored in the same format as orders downloaded using the [Export Orders](downloading-orders-from-bigcommerce) task, but the only required information is the  <id> of the orders.

### Notify Stage
_Required_  
The status to change the orders to. Defaults to 'Completed'.

### Zynk Settings
See [Common Task Settings](common-task-settings).

## Examples
You can find an example of how to use this task in the [BigCommerce to Sage 50 Integration](bigcommerce-to-sage-50-integration) article.

Sample input file which will update the status of order 105 to the status selected in the 'Notify Stage' setting.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<orders>
	<order>
		<id>105</id>
	</order>
</orders>
```

Sample XSLT file to use to transform orders exported from Sage in the Zynk XML Sales Orders format, to the BigCommerce order update format. This is also available in the [Auto Mapper](auto-mapper).

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">
	<xsl:output method="xml" indent="yes"/>
	<xsl:template match="/">
		<orders>
			<xsl:for-each select="Company/SalesOrders/SalesOrder">
				<order>
					<id>
						<xsl:value-of select="Id" />
					</id>
				</order>
			</xsl:for-each>
		</orders>
	</xsl:template>
</xsl:stylesheet>
```
