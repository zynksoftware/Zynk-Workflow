title: Uploading Sales Invoices to Sage Business Cloud
---
The Import Sales Invoices task will create new and update existing sales invoices in Sage Business Cloud. The sales invoice data must be provided in the [Sage Business Cloud Sales Invoice XML](sage-business-cloud-sales-invoice-xml) format.

## Settings
### Sage Business Cloud Connection
_Required_  
The connection to Sage Business Cloud to use. See [Connecting to Sage Business Cloud](connecting-to-sage-business-cloud) if you require more information on how to create/manage connections.

### Fail File
_Required_  
The name of a file for "failed" imports to be sent to.

### Input File
_Required_  
The source file that you want to import in Zynk XML format.

### Success File
_Required_  
The name of a file for "successful" imports to be sent to.

### Prevent Reprocessing
_Required_  
Set to true to prevent the same record being processed more than once. This will only work where an `external_id` is provided for a record in the input XML file.

### Zynk Settings
See [Common Task Settings](common-task-settings).

## Example
A sample input file is shown below. See [Sage Business Cloud Sales Invoice XML](sage-business-cloud-sales-invoice-xml) for full documentation of the XML format.
