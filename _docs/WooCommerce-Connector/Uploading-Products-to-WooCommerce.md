title: Importing Products to WooCommerce
---
This task will update or insert products into your WooCommerce store from an XML file. The products in the input file are matched to products in WooCommerce based on the `<id>` or the `<sku>`. If an `<id>` is provided, the existing product in WooCommerce with this ID will be updated. If a `<sku>` is provided and a product already exists in WooCommerce with a matching SKU, the existing product will be updated. Otherwise a new product will be created.

Please note the `<id>` must be provided to update existing draft products. Due to a limitation of the WooCommerce API, it is not possible to match draft products based on SKU.

## Examples
A sample input file showing a price and stock level update for the product with SKU 'ABC123' is shown below. The file is the same format as the output from the [Downloading Products from WooCommerce](downloading-products-from-woocommerce) task. Any fields which are not included in the XML won't be updated, and will keep their current value.
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<ProductList>
  <products>
    <product>
      <sku>ABC123</sku>
      <regular_price>10.00</regular_price>
      <managing_stock>true</managing_stock>
      <stock_quantity>88</stock_quantity>
      <in_stock>true</in_stock>
    </product>
  </products>
</ProductList>
```
