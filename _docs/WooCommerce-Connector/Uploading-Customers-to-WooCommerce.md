title: Importing Customers to WooCommerce
---
This task will update or insert customers into your WooCommerce store from an XML file. The customers in the input file are matched to customers in WooCommerce based on the `<id>` or the `<email>`. If an `<id>` is provided, the existing customer in WooCommerce with this ID will be updated. If an `<email>` is provided and a customer already exists in WooCommerce with a matching email, the existing customer will be updated. Otherwise a new customer will be created.

## Settings
### Connection
_Required_  
The WooCommerce connection to use. See the [Connecting to WooCommerce](connecting-to-woocommerce) article if you require more information on how to create/manage connections.

### Fail File
_Required_  
The name of the XML file to save any customers which fail to import to WooCommerce. Defaults to 'woo_commerce_customer_import_fail.xml'.

### Input File
_Required_  
The name of the XML file containing the customers to import to WooCommerce. Defaults to 'woo_commerce_customer_import.xml'.

### Success File
_Required_  
The name of the XML file to save any customers which successfully imported to WooCommerce. Defaults to 'woo_commerce_customer_import_success.xml'.

### Prevent Reprocessing
_Required_  
When set to true this will prevent another customer with the same `<external_id>` as a previously imported record from being imported to WooCommerce.

### Zynk Settings
See [Common Task Settings](common-task-settings).

## Examples
A sample input file showing an update for the customer with email address ' support@zynk.com' is shown below. The file is the same format as the output from the [Downloading Customers from WooCommerce](downloading-customers-from-woocommerce) task. Any fields which are not included in the XML won't be updated, and will keep their current value.
