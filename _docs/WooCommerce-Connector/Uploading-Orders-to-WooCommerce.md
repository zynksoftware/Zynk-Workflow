If a match is found, the existing order in WooCommerce will be updated. If no `<id>` is provided, a new order will be created.

Sample input file showing a status update for order ID 9. The file is the same format as the output from the [Downloading Orders from WooCommerce](downloading-orders-from-woocommerce) task. Any fields which are not included in the XML won't be updated, and will keep their current value.
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<OrderList>
  <orders>
    <order>
      <id>9</id>
      <status>processing</status>
    </order>
  </orders>
</OrderList>
```
