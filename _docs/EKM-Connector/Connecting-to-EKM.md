All of the tasks in the EKM connector require a connection to EKM, so you will need to create a connection with the type 'EKM'. See [Connection Manager](connection-manager) for instructions on creating a new connection. You will see a screen like the one below, requesting your EKM details:

Enter your EKM details as described below, then click 'Finish' to create the connection.

### Refresh Token
_Required_  
Click the 'Generate' button to create a refresh token. This will bring up a new window where you can log in to your EKM account, and grant Zynk access to your data. Once you have done this, a token will be automatically generated.
