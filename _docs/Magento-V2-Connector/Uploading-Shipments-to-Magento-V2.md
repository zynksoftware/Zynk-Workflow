title: Uploading Shipments to Magento V2
---
This task will create new shipments for existing orders in Magento. See below for a sample input file.

The `<entity_id>` element is used to specify the ID of the order to create the shipment for. If no ID is specified, the task will use the `<external_id>` element in conjunction with Zynk's truth table to look up the ID of an order that has been previously processed by Zynk. If no external ID is provided, the `<increment_id>` element will be used to look up the order ID based on the increment ID of the order.

You can optionally provide a collection of `<item>` elements to ship specific items on the order. If no items are provided, the task will ship all remaining items on the order.

## API Endpoint
##### [POST /V1/order/{orderId}/ship](https://devdocs.magento.com/redoc/2.3/admin-rest-api.html#operation/salesShipOrderV1ExecutePost)
_{orderId}_ The task will find a matching order id based on the data you provide.

## Input File
