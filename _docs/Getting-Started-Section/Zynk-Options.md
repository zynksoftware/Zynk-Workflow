 * In Zynk, there are a series of options you can configure to suit your requirements and preferences.

## General

![General](/assets/images/options/General.png)

 * **Data Path** You can configure a custom data path to store your Zynk data. This may be helpful if your C drive is particularly full.
 * **Workflow Options** You can choose whether double clicking a workflow can trigger the workflow to run or be edited.
 * **Text Editor** You can optionally edit files with your preferred local text editor.
 * **Start Page** Optionally disable the start page when you open the software.
 * **Connection Failure Notifications** Optionally enable email notifications that are triggered when a connection fails to authenticate properly. E.g, if you are running maintenance mode in Sage 50 whilst trying to run Zynk you would receive a notification.

## Display

* **Welcome Page** Optionally enable the statistics welcome page. This will give you information on records you have processed.

## SMTP

* **SMTP Details** If you are using either workflow reporting or connection failure reporting we would prefer you to use your own SMTP connection, however, we do provide a default connection (see above).

## Advanced

 * **Disable UI Logging** This is useful when your Zynk log database is getting full.
 * **Disable Debug Messages** Again, this is useful when your Zynk log database is getting full.
 * **SSL/TLS Version** If you're website or external system uses a certain version of SSL or TLS.
 * **Default Encoding** Optionally select a custom encoding. This is defaulted to UTF-8.
