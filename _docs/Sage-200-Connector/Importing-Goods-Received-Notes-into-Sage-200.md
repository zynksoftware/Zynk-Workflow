A sample input file for creating a goods note is shown below. This applies to workflows created in v2.22 of Zynk and above (using the ImportGoodsReceivedNotesV2 task). See our [Sage 200 GRN XML (V2)](sage-200-grn-xml-v2) for more details on the Zynk XML Receipt Note format for Sage 200.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

  <ReceiptNotes>
    <ReceiptNote>
      <Id>123456</Id>
      <PurchaseOrderNumber>38</PurchaseOrderNumber>
      <ReceiptDate>2012-10-03T10:00:00</ReceiptDate>
      <ReceiptReference>PROJ006</ReceiptReference>
      <ReceiptNarrative>Goods received</ReceiptNarrative>

          <Quantity>3</Quantity>
          <Location>HOME</Location>
          <Bin>B001</Bin>
          <Batches>
            <Batch>
              <IdentificationNo>0000000001</IdentificationNo>

          </Batches>
        </GoodsNote>
      </GoodsNotes>
    </ReceiptNote>
  </ReceiptNotes>
