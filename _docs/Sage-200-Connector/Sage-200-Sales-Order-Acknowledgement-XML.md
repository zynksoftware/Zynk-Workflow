The [Import Sales Order Acknowledgements into Sage 200](importing-sales-order-acknowledgements-into-sage-200) task allows you to acknowledge existing orders in Sage 200. The only information that needs to be provided in the XML is a list of orders you would like to acknowledge.

Please note that only orders of the type 'Sales Order' can be acknowledged.

## Order Identification
At least one of the following fields must be provided to identify which order to acknowledge in Sage. The fields will be considered in the following order: UniqueId, SalesOrderNumber, Id, CustomerOrderNumber. If no match is found based on any of these fields, the order won't be acknowledged.
