### Printing Picking Lists
If you have the 'Auto Print Picking List' setting enabled on the task, Zynk will automatically print the picking list for the orders imported. In some cases, Zynk will not be able to print picking lists due to the following error: 'A Linq Data Model named 'Sage 200 Accounts' could not be found. Check the Data Model parameter in the connection string, and ensure a model with that name exists in the model repository.' If this occurs, you will need to copy the following files:

 * C:\Program Files\Sage200\Unity.config
 * C:\Users\[*your user name*]\AppData\Local\Sage\Sage200\AssemblyCache\Sage.Accounting.DataModel.dll

into the Zynk install directory (by default this is C:\Program Files\Internetware\Zynk).
