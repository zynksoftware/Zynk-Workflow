title: Connecting to EKM Powershop

**This documentation refers to an older version of our EKM connector, which is no longer supported. See [EKM Connector](ekm) for the current version.**

All of the tasks in the EKM Powershop connector require a connection to EKM Powershop, so you will need to create aÂ connection with the type 'EKM Powershop'. SeeÂ  [Connection Manager](connection-manager) for instructions on creating a new connection. You will see a screen like the one below, requesting your EKM Powershop details:
