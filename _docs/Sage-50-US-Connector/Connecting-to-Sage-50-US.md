All of the tasks in the Sage 50 US connector require a connection to Sage 50 US, so you will need to create a  connection with the type 'Sage 50 US'. See [Connection Manager](connection-manager) for instructions on creating a new connection. You will see a screen like the one below, requesting your Sage 50 US details:

Enter your Sage 50 US details as described below, then click 'Finish' to create the connection.

## Settings
### Server Name
_Optional_  
If your Sage 50 US data is stored the same machine that Zynk is installed on, this field can be left blank. If the data is on another machine on the network, you will need to enter its name.

### Company
_Required_  
Click the 'Refresh' button to display the list of companies. Select the one you want to connect to from the list.

The first time Zynk tries to connect to Sage 50 US, you will get an error stating that Zynk needs to be authorised to access your data. To do this, open the Sage 50 US application, sign in to the company, and allow access when prompted.
