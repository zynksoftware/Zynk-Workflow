Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language which is a commonly used file format for interchanging data over the Internet. XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) is a language for transforming XML documents into other XML documents, or other formats such as HTML for web pages and plain text.

More information on XML and XSLT can be found on the [W3C website](http://www.w3.org/standards/xml/).

Many of the tasks in Zynk accept and return XML files in order to integrate data between systems. Zynk provides the following set of tasks to enable you to process these files. There is also an [Auto Mapper](auto-mapper) task in [Zynk Core](zynk-core) which uses built in XSLT files to provide instant mappings for a number of connectors.

## Tasks
- [If XML Contains](if-xml-contains)
- [Merging XML Files](merging-xml-files)
- [XML Repeater](xml-repeater)
- [Selecting a Value from an XML File](selecting-a-value-from-an-xml-file)
- [Splitting XML Files](splitting-xml-files)
- [Converting XML to CSV](converting-xml-to-csv)
- [XSLT Transform](xslt-transform)

## Examples
For usage of the different XML tasks please see our [Using XML Library](using-xml-library) tutorial.
