title: Import Customers to My Mobile Workers

The My Mobile Workers platform will allow you to import customers via the API. For example, if you have customer records that are maintained in an external system that you want to keep up to date in My Mobile Workers you would use this task as part of your process to import them.

The API documentation provided by My Mobile Workers is available [here](https://docs.mymobileworkers.com/index.php?title=Add_Customer).
