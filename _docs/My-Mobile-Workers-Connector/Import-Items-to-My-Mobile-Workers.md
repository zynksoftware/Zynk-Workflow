title: Import Items to My Mobile Workers
---
The My Mobile Workers platform will allow you to import items via the API. For example, if you have product records that are maintained in an external system that you want to keep up to date in My Mobile Workers you would use this task as part of your process to import them.

The API documentation provided by My Mobile Workers is available [here](https://docs.mymobileworkers.com/index.php?title=Create_Items).

This task will import items to My Mobile Workers in an XML format.
