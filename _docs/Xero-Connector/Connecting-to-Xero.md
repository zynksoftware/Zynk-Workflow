title: Connecting to Xero

All of the tasks in the Xero connector require a connection to Xero, so you will need to create a connection with the type 'Xero'. SeeÂ [Managing Connections](managing-connections) for instructions on creating a new connection.

Zynk connects to Xero using the private API, which requires you to set up a private application in Xero. Xero provide instructions on how to do this in the documentation section of their site under [Private Applications](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/auth-and-limits/private-applications/). Note that the name for the private application is not important, so you can choose anything (such as 'Zynk Integration').

In Zynk you will see a screen like the one below, requesting your Xero private application details:
