title: Importing Records to SugarCRM
---


This task will insert a new record or update an existing record in Sugar CRM. An update is performed if the record ID was provided in the input file, or an existing record is found in Sugar where the value of the key field matches the value specified in the input file. If no matching record is found, a new record will be created in Sugar.



The task supports setting relationships to existing records in Sugar, using the [link field](link-fields) name. The record to link to must already exist in Sugar, the task will not create it if it does not exist. Any field can be used to look up the related record in Sugar, such as the ID or Name, and the task will use the first matching record found.

## Examples


You can find an example of how to use this task in the [Sugar CRM to Sage 50 Integration](sugar-crm-to-sage-50-integration) article.



The sample input file shown below will create a new account called "Zynk Software Ltd", and update the existing account with ID 52828444-a7fc-4ecc-72f8-51a48143b6ed. Note that the XPath Query setting would need to be set to  `Rows/Row` to access the records contained in this file.


```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Rows>
  <Row name="Zynk Software Ltd" phone_office="123456789" />
  <Row id="52828444-a7fc-4ecc-72f8-51a48143b6ed" name="Internetware Ltd" phone_office="123456789" />
</Rows>
```


A sample success file is shown below, containing the ID of the newly created account.


```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Rows>
  <Row id="cbef463d-13ed-4a25-ae54-828985fa37a2" name="Zynk Software Ltd" phone_office="123456789" />
  <Row id="52828444-a7fc-4ecc-72f8-51a48143b6ed" name="Internetware Ltd" phone_office="123456789" />
</Rows>
```


The sample input file shown below shows the creation of an opportunity with a related account. In this case the [link field](link-fields) "accounts" is set to the account with ID 5f87cba4-a90e-3b2a-57ab-5305f2776fea. Note that the XPath Query setting would need to be set to `Opportunities/Opportunity` to access the records contained in this file.


```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Opportunities>
  <Opportunity name="Zynk Software" date_closed="2014-09-25" sales_stage="Closed Won" amount="175" description="New printer">
	<accounts>
	  <id>5f87cba4-a90e-3b2a-57ab-5305f2776fea</id>
	</accounts>
  </Opportunity>
</Opportunities>
```
