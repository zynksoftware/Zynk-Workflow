Each task within the Quikflw connector requires a connection to Quikflw, so you will need to create a connection with the type 'Quikflow'. See [Managing Connections](managing-connections) for instructions on creating a new connection.

You will see a user interface like the one below, requesting your Quikflw Api key.
