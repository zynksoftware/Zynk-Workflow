To integrate with [Quikflw](quikflw) using Zynk you will need to import and export data using XML.  The field names and types used are the similar to the [Quikflw API Documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/5351616/RWgtTx86), however, it is in XML format rather than JSON.

The format for downloading and uploading are the same for each record type, but there are certain fields that only used when creating a record for the first time, updating an existing record, or when downloading a record.  These are highlighted on each page, along with the data types and restrictions.
