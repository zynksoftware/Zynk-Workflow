The SFTP Connector allows you to send and receive files from a web based SFTP server. To integrate with FTP or FTP over SSL (FTPS), you will need to use [FTP](ftp) instead.

Each of the tasks use an SFTP Connection, for more information on setting up and managing connections see the page [Connecting to an SFTP Server](connecting-to-an-sftp-server).  The connector supports both username/password and public key authentication.
