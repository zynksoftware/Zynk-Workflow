The WooCommerce connector for Zynk allows you to easily integrate with your WooCommerce store. It provides tasks to export order, product and customer information in XML format, and import products, stock levels, customers and orders.

Each of the tasks require a connection to WooCommerce, for more information on setting up and managing connections see [Connecting to WooCommerce V3.0+](connecting-to-woocommerce-v3).

Please note that this connector only supports WooCommerce version 3.0 and above. If you are using a version of WooCommerce between 2.2 and 2.7, you will need to use our [WooCommerce V2.2+](woocommerce) connector. We do not support any versions older than 2.2.
