title: Connecting to WooCommerce V3.0+
---
All of the tasks in the WooCommerce V3.0+ connector require a connection to WooCommerce, so you will need to create a connection with the type 'WooCommerce Version 3.0+'. See [Managing Connections](managing-connections) for instructions on creating a new connection. You will see a screen like the one below, requesting your WooCommerce details:

## Settings
### URL

Enter your WooCommerce API Consumer Secret. This can be generated from your site's admin, under Users > Your Profile > WooCommerce API Keys.

### Authentication Method
_Required_  
Choose which authentication method to use.
- **QueryString** - This option will send your authentication details to WooCommerce as part of the query string on each API request. Use this option if your server is unable to parse the authorization header correctly.
