You can use Zynk Log Manager (ZLM) to perform a variety of operations on your two Zynk databases (Zynk.sdf and Log.sdf). 

The two database files are located in your data directory, typically this is C:\ProgramData\Zynk Software\Zynk\2.0, although if you have configured a custom data directory in 'Tools -> Options' your database files will be located there. You can browse to your custom data directory if necessary.

As the Sql CE version was updated to 4.0 in version 2.16 of Zynk Workflow, you can select whether to use a Sql CE 3.5 connection or a Sql CE 4.0 connection. For clarification, please see the below: -

* __Versions 2.16 or higher__ use the Sql CE 4.0 connection
* __Versions lower than 2.16__ use the Sql CE 3.5 connection

If you enter the correct Sql CE version, the full path to your database file, your password (if required), size and click connect, you can query the database you've selected for information.

If you enter all the above information and don't click connect, you can verify (test the connection), compact, repair and shrink your database.

* __Verify__ - This method will test the connection details you have entered into ZLM. For further information please visit [MSDN article](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/a0a5czch(v=vs.100).aspx) related to verifying a database.
* __Compact__ - This action will reclaim wasted space in the database by recreating the file. For further information please visit [MSDN article](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.sqlserverce.sqlceengine.compact(v=vs.100).aspx) related to compacting a database.
* __Repair__ - This method will attempt to repair a broken database. For further information please visit [MSDN article](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.sqlserverce.sqlceengine.repair(v=vs.100).aspx) related to repairing a database.
* __Shrink__ - This method will attempt to recover wasted space in the database by removing empty page files. For further information please visit [MSDN article](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.sqlserverce.sqlceengine.shrink(v=vs.100).aspx) related to shrinking a database.
