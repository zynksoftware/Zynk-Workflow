The Sage 50 Payroll connector implements an interface to Sage 50 Payroll and provides functions to import data into Sage 50 Payroll in Zynk XML format. For detailed schema information on the Zynk XML standard please see [Sage 50 Payroll XML](sage-50-payroll-xml).

The Sage 50 Payroll connector relies on the appropriate version of the Sage 50 Payroll SDO to be registered on the computer that Zynk is running from. 

When running a Sage 50 Payroll task, Zynk will attempt to retrieve the SDO and register it on the computer, as such, you may need to run Zynk as an administrator to complete this process. See the Supported Versions below for more information on the versions of Sage 50 Payroll supported by Zynk. 

Each of the tasks in this library require a connection to Sage 50 Payroll, for more information on setting up and managing connections see [Connecting to Sage 50 Payroll](connecting-to-sage-50-payroll).
