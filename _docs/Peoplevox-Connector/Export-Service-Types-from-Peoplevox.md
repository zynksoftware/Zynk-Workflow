This task will export service type information from Peoplevox in XML format, for detailed information see [Peoplevox Service Type XML](peoplevox-service-type-xml).  The information is exported using the "Service types" report that can be ran through your Peoplevox web application.  You can add date filters and search clauses to limit the data that is returned.
