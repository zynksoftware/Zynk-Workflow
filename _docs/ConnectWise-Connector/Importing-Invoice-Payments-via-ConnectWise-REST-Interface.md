title: Importing Invoice Payments via ConnectWise REST Interface
---
This task will import invoice payments into ConnectWise from an XML file. See below for a sample input file. 

Invoice payments are created/updated based on the following rules:
* If an `<id>` is specified, the task will update the payment with this ID.
* If an `<externalId>` is specified, and a corresponding entry is found in Zynk's truth table, the task will update the payment with this ID.
* If one or more `<lookup>` elements have been specified, Zynk will search for a match based on each one in turn, and will update the first matching payment it finds.
* If a payment already exists for the specified invoice, the task will update the existing payment.
* If none of the above conditions are met, the task will create a new payment.

When updating existing payments, only writeable fields specified in the input file will be updated. Any other fields will keep their existing values.

Please note that ConnectWise only allow a single payment per invoice.
