title: Importing Shipments to Magento

This task will import shipments to existing orders in Magento. Optionally, you can provide a list of specific items and quantities to ship, or just provide the order number and the task will automatically ship all items. Optionally, you can process the order further by creating an invoice, and processing a payment against that invoice.
