The eBay connector for Zynk allows you to download your orders and listings from eBay in XML format. They can then be processed using any of the other tasks in Zynk to import them into your Accounting, ERP, CRM or database.

Each of the tasks require a connection to eBay, for more information on setting up and managing connections see [Connecting to eBay](connecting-to-ebay).

Please note that only the UK eBay marketplace is supported.

You will need to add your SKU codes to eBay to make use of this connector. You can find instructions on how to do this in [Adding SKU Codes to eBay Items](adding-sku-codes-to-ebay-items).
