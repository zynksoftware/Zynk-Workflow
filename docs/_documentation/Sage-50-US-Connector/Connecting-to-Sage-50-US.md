## Settings
### Server Name

If your Sage 50 US data is stored the same machine that Zynk is installed on, this field can be left blank. If the data is on another machine on the network, you will need to enter its name.

### Company

Click the 'Refresh' button to display the list of companies. Select the one you want to connect to from the list.
