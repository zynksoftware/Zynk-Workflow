All of the tasks in the Brightpearl Connector require a Brightpearl connection, so you will need to create a connection with the type 'Brightpearl'. See [Managing Connections](managing-connections) for instructions on creating a new connection. You will see a screen like the one below, requesting your Brightpearl details:
