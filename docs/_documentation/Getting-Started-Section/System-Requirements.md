## What do I need to run Zynk?

Zynk can be installed on most Windows based PCs running one of the following operating systems:

 * Windows Vista SP2 (x86 and x64)
 * Windows 7 SP1 (x86 and x64)
 * Windows 8
 * Windows 8.1

 * Windows Server 2008 SP2 (x86 and x64)

### Additional Notes

 * If you are integrating with Sage 50, Sage 200 or ACT!, an instance of that software will need to be installed on the same machine that Zynk is installed on.
 * Zynk requires the .Net Framework version 4.5.2 or above, which may need to be installed during the installation process.
 * Zynk uses SQL Server Compact Edition which may need to be downloaded and installed during the installation process.
 * Zynk will run on most virtual machines, we are aware of some minor issues with Oracle VirtualBox.
