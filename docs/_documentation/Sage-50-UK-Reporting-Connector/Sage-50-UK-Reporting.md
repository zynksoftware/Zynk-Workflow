The Reporting for Sage 50 connector allows you to generate reports using the layouts you have in Sage 50.

The first time you run any task Zynk will request your Sage 50 login credentials via the following screen - select the Company, Username and Password. You will only be asked for this information once as the Workflow will store the login details in Workflow variables
