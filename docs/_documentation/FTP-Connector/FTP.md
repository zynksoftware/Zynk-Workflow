The FTP Connector allows you to send and receive files from a web based FTP server. Both FTP and FTP over SSL (FTPS) are supported. To integrate with an SFTP server, you will need to use [SFTP](sftp) instead.

Each of the tasks use an FTP connection, for more information on setting up and managing connections see the page [Connecting to an FTP Server](connecting-to-an-ftp-server).
